This project is a fully functional Food Order Web Application developed to streamline the process of browsing and ordering food online. It combines modern web development practices with robust backend functionality to create a seamless user experience. The application is built using Java Server Pages (JSP) for the dynamic user interface, Java Servlets for handling HTTP requests, and JDBC for database connectivity. The backend is powered by a MySQL database, which stores user data, food items, and order details.

To enhance the application's visual appeal and responsiveness, Tailwind CSS is used for the front-end styling. The application ensures that users can interact with it efficiently on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. The project also features a secure user authentication system that allows customers to register and log in to their accounts to place orders.

The application provides an Admin Panel where administrators can manage food categories, add or remove items from the catalog, and track orders placed by customers. Users can browse through a categorized menu, view detailed information about each food item, and add items to their cart. The cart feature allows users to review their selections and proceed to checkout.

This project is deployed on an Apache Tomcat server, and its modular structure ensures maintainability and scalability. The database schema is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, with proper relationships and indexing to optimize query performance.

Future enhancements include integrating a payment gateway, implementing user reviews and ratings for food items, and optimizing backend processes for faster response times. This application serves as an excellent example of how modern web technologies can be combined to deliver a practical and user-friendly solution for online food ordering systems.
